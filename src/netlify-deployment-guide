# API Keymaster - Netlify Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying the API Keymaster application to Netlify.

## Prerequisites

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) account
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your local machine

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. Copy all the files from this project into your repository

## Step 2: Set Up the Project Structure

Ensure your project has the following structure:

```
api-keymaster/
├── netlify.toml
├── package.json
├── netlify/
│   └── functions/
│       └── api-keymaster.js
├── public/
│   └── index.html
└── src/
    └── (put additional static assets here)
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies for your project.

## Step 4: Test Locally with Netlify Dev

1. Install the Netlify CLI if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
netlify dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8888` to test your application locally.

## Step 5: Deploy to Netlify

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

2. Log in to your Netlify account
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Choose GitHub as your Git provider
5. Select your repository
6. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `public`
7. Click "Deploy site"

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Build your site:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy using the Netlify CLI:

```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

For production, you should set the following environment variables in the Netlify dashboard:

1. Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment
2. Add the following variables:
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A secure random string for JWT token signing
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production`

## Step 7: Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In the Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings > Domain management
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the instructions to set up your domain

## Usage

Once deployed, your API Keymaster application will be available at your Netlify domain. Users can:

1. Create an account with a username and master password
2. Add API keys for different platforms
3. View, copy, and manage their keys securely
4. Use the keys in their projects by copying them or using environment variables

## Security Considerations

- All API keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Keys are only decrypted with the user's master password
- The master password is never stored on the server
- The application uses JWTs for session management
- All data is stored in Netlify's Key-Value store, not in the code repository

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Check the Netlify deploy logs
2. Make sure all required environment variables are set
3. Verify your project structure matches the recommended layout
4. Test locally with `netlify dev` to identify any issues
